    By default, when using DesignatorDropdownGroupDef, the game won't open the Stuff Selection Dropdown when using Stuffed ThingDefs, 
	making it impossible to use a combination of both Dropdowns, and Stuffed Things
	
	This patches the Dropdown Designators (defs with designatorDropdown) to also support Stuffed ThingDefs (defs with stuffCategories),
	after selecting the Building designation in the dropdown, it'll select the Building designation as well as open the Stuff selection dropdown,
	at which point you can move the mouse away, or select the stuff variant to construct.
	
	Doesn't affect normal Dropdowns, nor Stuffed things without a dropdown group

	---
	Dev Notes:
	
	Patch transpiles Designator_Dropdown::ProcessEvent to include a call before the constructor to FloatMenu 
	which then patches the actions of the FloatMenuOptions, and wraps the call with another one that calls the ProcessEvent of the underlying Designator after calling the old action
	Shouldn't cause any incompatibilities
